### About

`inro` is primarily a library of HOCs to compose enhanced react components that
are flexible and easy to use for responsive designs.

#### What is an "inro"?

> "An _inrō_ is a traditional Japanese case for holding small objects, suspended
> from the _obi_ (sash) worn around the waist. They are often highly decorated,
> in a variety of materials and techniques, in particular often using lacquer."
>  &mdash; [Wikipedia][1]
>
> "Consisting of a stack of tiny, nested boxes, _inrō_ were most commonly used
> to carry identity seals and medicine." &mdash; [Wikipedia][1]

#### Why make this when library "X" already exists?

[Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) is probably the defining layout
system used by most of the web, so I wanted something that out of the box
mimicked the look and feel that its grid system has. Beyond that, writing CSS
for specific screen sizes is a pain to do in a maintainable way. I wanted
something that one could, with little setup, easily add styles to defined
breakpoints.

#### Is this performant?

Probably not, but it is easy to use and works well enough.
