# inro docs

The docs for this repo are in normal markdown and are accompanied by some
examples for viewing on the website too.

## READMEs

*   [About](./about/)
*   [Components](./components/)
*   [Constants](./constants/)
*   [HOCs](./hocs/)

## Website

The website is built with [`next.js`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/). To
build and view locally run `npm run dev` in the [`docs`](./) directory.

For now, updating the `README.md`s will not hot update.

## Logo

If you want to use the logo or edit it, there is an editable sketch file in
[`static`](./static) as well as two PNGs (one with white text, one with black
text).
